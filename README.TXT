INTRODUCTION
-------------
The primary goal and purpose of ZipZap is to make working with ZIP files as easy and painless as possible while integrating the process with the OS/2 WorkPlace Shell. 

ZipZap for OS/2 is a fast integrated 32bit utility that makes working with ZIP files easier than ever.  Zip, unzip, view, and more. WorkPlace Shell level integration makes it an indespensable tool for any OS/2 Desktop!   
Requires Warp 3.x or Warp 4.x and the ZIP archive programs ZIP.EXE and UNZIP.EXE (available free from InfoZip).
